# Welcome to Uptime Labs 👋

## 🚀 Our Mission

At Uptime Labs, we're on a mission to help companies master incident response. We believe that preparation and practice are key to operational resilience.

## 🙋‍♀️ About Us

Uptime Labs is the incident manager's incident flight simulator — a training ground for responding confidently and flawlessly to any incident or scenario. We've adopted safety-critical procedures from industries like aviation and applied them to IT incident management.

## 👩‍💻 Our Experience

With 15 years of experience as sleep-deprived software engineers on support rota for a financial trading platform, we've been there:

- Frozen behind the keyboard during major incidents
- Dealing with C-level colleagues watching over our shoulder
- Justifying spending millions on monitoring and APM tools
- Learning the hard way about the importance of tool familiarity before crises hit

We created Uptime Labs to make all of this stress manageable and, dare we say it, *fun*!
